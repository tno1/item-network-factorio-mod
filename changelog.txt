Version: 0.8.4
Date: 11. 09. 2023

    - Fixed bug when deconstructing logistic entities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.8.1
Date: 08. 09. 2023
  Features:
    - Added a Network Sensor that outputs the count of items in the network and updates every 2 seconds.
    - Added a "Performance" Tab hidden behind a setting that displays durations for performance-critical parts of the mod. Should help while optimizing the mod.

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed bug where game would crash when copying to/from a Network Chest to a non-assembler entity like a normal chest.
    - Fixed bug where the setting to disable logistic integrations didn't work for missing items.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.8.0
Date: 03. 09. 2023
  Features:
    - Enhanced copy-paste behavior between Network Chests and assemblers. If you copy from a Network Chest and paste on an assembler, it add requests for recipe ingredients for the recipe. If you copy from an assembler and paste on a Network Chest, it will provide recipe products from the chest.
    - Network Chest Loaders now have a list of suggested filters when attached to a Network Chest.

  Changes:
    - Changed network chest copy-past behavior so subsequent copies and pastes to the same Network Chest append items rather than overrite items. This should make it easier to have one chest supply multiple assemblers.
    - All fluids with non-integer temperatures now round up to the nearest temperature when inserted into the network. This makes it possible to request those fluid temps from a Network Tank using the rounded temperature. Please submit a bug if this breaks an existing factory.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.0
Date: 29. 07. 2023
  Features:
    - Network Tanks now support fluids with different temperatures! Make sure that if you provide fluids at non-default temperatures (like steam) you update all requester tanks with the new temperature. You can use the Network View to see which fluids are in your network to help debug.
    - Added tooltips to items and fluids in the Network View.

  Changes:
    - Network Tanks that are configured as Providers now only need "limit" and will try to push any fluids into the network.
